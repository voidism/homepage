## About me

Yung-Sung Chuang is now an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. His research interest broadly covers the deep learning technique for natural language processing and speech processing. In particular, he aims to utilize the ability of machines to help people grasp large information in text/audio form in efficient ways. Towards this goal, he joined Speech Processing Lab supervised by [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html) and Machine Intelligence Understanding Lab supervised by [Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/). He has several publications on related topics, such as spoken question answering, clinical text conclusion generation, and Chinese word segmentation.
